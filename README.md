# mm_geo_coder_UAT
## 🧪 UAT Test for mm_geo_coder Module
**Project:** Testing `mm_geo_coder`  
**Version:** 0.2.1  
**Date:** 25-June-2025 to 15-July-2025

## 🔍 Overview
You are participating in User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for the mm_geo_coder system — a geolocation service that turns Myanmar text addresses into coordinates and vice versa. Your role is to act as an end user, helping us validate that the system works as expected before it's released for production.

You will also help collect address data from various sources, which will be used for both training and testing purposes.

🎯 Your Responsibilities
### 1. Data Collection

- Collect at least **2000 real-world addresses** from diverse sources:
  - Urban and rural addresses
  - Address from different regions and states
  - Full and partial address
- Record them in the provided spreadsheet with these columns:
  - `Data Source`
  - `Original Address`
  - `Notes`

- Use trusted sources such as:
   - `Yellow Book`
   - `Public Business Addressses from social media such as Facebook`
   - `Online maps` (OpenStreetMap, Google Maps)

### 2. Testing Tasks
You will use the mm_geo_coder Python module to test:
- Geocoding (address → coordinates)
- Issues when invalid input is provided
- Module's handling of missing or partial data
- Upload bulk address data (CSV format)
- Compare system outputs with expected results

- At least 5 bugs or issues reported per tester (even small ones)
- Respect data quality — real, diverse addresses matter

### 5. 💬 Support
- Daily check-ins or Q&A sessions via [Telegram]
- You can ask questions, flag uncertainties, or propose improvements

📅 Timeline
- **Week 1**: Orientation + Data Collection
- **Week 2**: Execute test cases
- **Week 3**: Bug review & feedback summary

### 6. 🎓 Learning Outcomes
- Real-world experience in software testing and data validation
- Exposure to geolocation services and APIs
- Hands-on practice with UAT documentation and quality assurance
